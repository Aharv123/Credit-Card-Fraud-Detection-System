This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions, it builds and trains a machine learning model to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.


1] Install the dataset from this link "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud"
2] pip install -r requirements.txt     to install the libraries
3] create Folder named "data" in the project and put the downloaded dataset
4] also put that same dataset directly in Jupyter Notebook folder too

** This is because the File was too big so i had to gitignore it **

5] Then run the file named "data_exploration.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook folder
6] Then run "training.ipynb" in same folder
7] Now go to src folder and run all the files but Make sure to run predictor.py at the end cause thats the main file to check the credit card fraud.
