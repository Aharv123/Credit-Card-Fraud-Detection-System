Project Description
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is designed to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. This project employs machine learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The model is trained on a dataset, and predictions are made using a trained machine learning model.

The project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning.

Model Training: Building and training a model using various machine learning algorithms.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Deployment: A Flask-based app for making real-time predictions, based on the trained model.

Dataset
To run the project, you need the dataset for training the model. Download the dataset from the following Kaggle link:

Dataset Link: Credit Card Fraud Dataset on Kaggle

After downloading the dataset, follow these steps:

Create a folder named data in the root directory of the project.

Place the downloaded dataset (creditcard.csv) inside the data folder.

Also, place the CSV file directly inside the Jupyter Notebook folder for your convenience.

File Structure
The project consists of several Python files that handle different tasks:

src/data_preprocessing.py: This file handles the data cleaning and preprocessing.

src/model.py: Defines and trains the machine learning model.

src/predictor.py: This is the final file used for making predictions after the model is trained.

Jupyter Notebook/data_exploration.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for initial data exploration and visualization.

Jupyter Notebook/training.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to train the model on the dataset.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Data Preprocessing:
Run the data_preprocessing.py file first. This will clean and preprocess the data, making it ready for training. It handles tasks like feature extraction, normalization, and preparing the data for the model.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Model Training:
Next, run the model.py file. This file will build the machine learning model (like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.) and train it on the preprocessed dataset.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/model.py
Prediction:
After the model is trained, you can make predictions using the predictor.py file. This file will load the trained model and make predictions on new data or on the test set.

bash

python src/predictor.py
Conclusion
After completing the above steps, you will have a trained model capable of predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. The final output will be a prediction of whether the transaction is legitimate or fraudulent, along with the probability of it being fraudulent.
