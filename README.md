Credit Card Fraud Detection System
Project Description
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based project that identifies fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. This system uses various machine learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning.

Model Training: Building and training a model using various machine learning algorithms.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using a test dataset.

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Deployment: Creating a Flask-based application for making real-time predictions using the trained model.

Dataset
To run the project, you need to download the dataset from the following Kaggle link:

Credit Card Fraud Dataset on Kaggle

Dataset Setup
Create a folder named data in the root directory of the project.

Place the downloaded dataset (creditcard.csv) inside the data folder.

Additionally, place the creditcard.csv file directly inside the Jupyter Notebook folder for convenience.

File Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

bash
Copy
Edit
/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
    /data
        creditcard.csv
    /Jupyter Notebook
        data_exploration.ipynb
        training.ipynb
    /src
        data_preprocessing.py
        model.py
        predictor.py
    /models
        best_model.pkl
        scaler.pkl
    /requirements.txt
    /README.md
/src: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

/Jupyter Notebook: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and training the model.

/models: Contains saved models and scaler for future predictions.

/data: Folder to store the dataset.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Data Preprocessing
Run the data_preprocessing.py script first to clean and preprocess the data. This step handles tasks like feature extraction, normalization, and preparing the data for training.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/data_preprocessing.py
2. Model Training
Next, run the model.py script. This script builds and trains the machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost) on the preprocessed dataset.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/model.py
3. Prediction
Once the model is trained, you can use the predictor.py file to make predictions on new data or the test set.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/predictor.py
Requirements
You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes all the necessary libraries and their versions required to run the project.

Conclusion
After completing the steps above, you will have a trained machine learning model capable of predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model will output whether the transaction is legitimate or fraudulent, along with the probability of it being fraudulent.
