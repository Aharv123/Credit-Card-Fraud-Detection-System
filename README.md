Overview
The project uses a dataset containing credit card transactions, with each transaction labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict whether a new transaction is fraudulent based on the patterns learned from the historical data.

Key features of the system:

Real-time fraud detection: Classifies each transaction as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Machine learning model: The system uses various classification algorithms to predict the outcome of each transaction.

Data preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and feature engineering is done to ensure that the model gets the right features for prediction.

Technologies
This project is built using the following technologies:

Python: Programming language used for the implementation.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to implement algorithms.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework (if used).

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization libraries to explore the data and results.

Git & GitHub: Version control and code hosting.

Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You'll also need the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

tensorflow (if applicable)

matplotlib

seaborn

To install the required dependencies, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for training the fraud detection model is creditcard.csv, which contains transaction details with a target label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. This dataset can be found in the data directory.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Before training the model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This includes:

Handling missing data

Feature scaling and normalization

Encoding categorical variables

Model Training: Use the train.py script to train the model on the preprocessed data. The script will automatically split the data into training and testing sets and perform training using various algorithms.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on the test set. The accuracy and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are reported.

Prediction: Use the predictor.py script to classify new transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on the trained model.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/predictor.py
The model will output a prediction with the probability of the transaction being fraudulent or legitimate.

Model
The fraud detection model uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural Networks

These models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best_model.pkl contains the trained model that can be used for making predictions on new data.

Model Training Example
python
Copy
Edit
from src.model import FraudDetectionModel

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/creditcard.csv")

# Preprocess data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(df)

# Initialize and train the model
model = FraudDetectionModel()
model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# Save the trained model
model.save_model("models/best_model.pkl")
Results
The model has been trained on the creditcard.csv dataset, and its performance has been evaluated using various metrics such as:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.

Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.

Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The model's performance on the test set can be seen in the results.txt or the output of the evaluate() function.
